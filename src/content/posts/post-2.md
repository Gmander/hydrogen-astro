<!-- 870 X 580 -->
As a developer, I often find myself working with large bodies of text — whether it’s code, log files, or configuration files. Finding specific information within these large text files can be a time-consuming and tedious task. That’s where *grep* comes in.

*Grep* is a powerful command-line tool that allows you to search for specific patterns within text files. It uses regular expressions to match patterns and can be used to search not only for specific strings but also for more complex patterns such as regular expressions, making it an essential tool for any developer.

Personally, I found grep useful when needing to manipulate large quantities of files in S3 buckets through python scripts. Its speed with ripping through thousands of files blew my mind then and still does now.

Since I dedicated some time to deep diving into *grep*, the return on investment has been substantial. In this blog, I want to share my experiences with *grep* and how it has become an indispensable tool in my development workflow.

#### Basic usage

The basic usage of *grep* is straightforward — you simply pass it a string to search for and a file to search in. For example:

```ssh
grep "hello" file.txt
```

This command will search for the string “hello” in the file *file.txt*. If there are any matches, *grep* will print the lines containing the match.

#### Regular expressions

One of the most powerful features of *grep* is its ability to search using regular expressions. Regular expressions (regex) are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. They can be used to match complex patterns, making *grep* an incredibly versatile tool.

> Quick side note: I recommend checking out this [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-regex-7aeaf4dd25e9) on [Ray Johns](https://medium.com/@rayljohns) post on improving your regex, I found it both humorous and informative.

For example, let’s say we have a file that contains a list of email addresses. We want to find all the email addresses that end in “.com”. We can do this using the following command:

```ssh
grep "\.com$" emails.txt
```

Here, we’re using the regular expression “.com$”, which means “find all lines that end with ‘.com’”. The backslash before the dot is needed to escape the dot character because it has a special meaning in regular expressions.

#### Extended regular expressions

*Grep* also supports extended regular expressions (ERE) using the `-E` flag. EREs offer more functionality and are easier to read than basic regular expressions (BRE). EREs include special characters such as `?`, `+`, `{}`, and `|`, which are used to match specific patterns.

For example, let’s say we have a file containing a list of phone numbers, and we want to find all phone numbers that start with either “555” or “666”. We can use the following command:

```ssh
grep -E "^555|^666" phone_numbers.txt
```

Here, we’re using the `-E` flag to enable extended regular expressions. The `^` character matches the beginning of a line, and the `|` character acts as an OR operator.

#### Positive/Negative Lookahead/Lookbehind

One of the most powerful features of *grep* is its ability to use lookarounds, which are assertions that allow you to match patterns only if certain conditions are met. Lookarounds include positive and negative lookahead and lookbehind.

For example, let’s say we have a JSON file with a key-value pair `”city”: “New York”`, and we want to find all instances of `”city”` where the value is not `”New York”`. We can use the negative lookahead as follows:

```ssh
grep -P '"city":\s*"(?!New York)[^"]+"' data.json
```

Here, we’re using the `-P` flag to enable Perl-compatible regular expressions, which supports lookarounds. The negative lookahead `”(?!New York)”` specifies that

**Positive lookahead** (`(?=)`) allows you to match patterns only if they are followed by a specific pattern. For example, let’s say you have a file that contains the words “state” and “code”, and you only want to return instances of “state” if they are followed by the word “code”. You can use positive lookahead as follows:

```ssh
grep -Pr "state(?=code)" file.txt
```

Here, *grep* will only return instances of “state” that are followed by “code”. This is useful when you want to match patterns only if they are followed by a specific pattern.

**Negative lookahead** (`(?!)`), on the other hand, allows you to match patterns only if they are not followed by a specific pattern. For example, let’s say you have a file that contains the words “statecode” and “statezip”, and you only want to return instances of “state” that are not followed by the word “code”. You can use negative lookahead as follows:

```ssh
grep -Pr "(?<!state)code" file.txt
```

Here, *grep* will not return instances of “code” that are preceded by “state”, but it will return any other instance of “code”. This is useful when you want to exclude patterns that are preceded by a specific pattern.

Positive and negative lookahead and lookbehind are powerful features of *grep* that can help you find specific patterns within text files. They allow you to specify conditions for matches and exclude patterns that do not meet those conditions. These features are essential for anyone working with large bodies of text and can save you a lot of time and effort in finding the patterns you need.
